"""Route PyYAML through libyaml's C parser/emitter. Import for the side effect.

The conformance render is dominated by YAML: the resolvers parse the whole fixture
corpus and re-emit every staged file, and the generator re-loads it per peer version.
PyYAML's pure-Python SafeLoader/SafeDumper are what that time is actually spent in —
in one resolver run the emitter alone was 72% of tottime. CSafeLoader/CSafeDumper
produce identical documents (verified byte-identical across the staged corpus), so
this patches `yaml.safe_load` / `yaml.safe_dump` at module level ONCE.

Patching the module rather than each call site is deliberate: fixtures.py, markers.py,
and the tables package call `yaml.safe_load` directly at call time, so one import here
covers them without a copy of the shim in each file. Every module that reads or writes
fixture YAML on the render path imports this instead of rolling its own.
